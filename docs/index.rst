MicroCeph
=========

MicroCeph is the easiest way to get up and running with Ceph.

MicroCeph is a lightweight way of deploying a Ceph cluster using just a few
commands. Ceph is a highly scalable, open-source distributed storage system
designed to provide excellent performance, reliability, and flexibility for
object, block, and file-level storage.

Ceph cluster management is streamlined by simplifying key distribution, service
placement, and disk administration for quick, effortless deployment and
operations. This applies to clusters that span private clouds, edge clouds, as
well as home labs and single workstations.

MicroCeph is focused on providing a modern deployment and management experience
to traditional Ceph cluster administrators as well as software storage
developers.

===================
``microceph`` charm
===================

The ``microceph`` charm is used to incorporate MicroCeph into Juju-managed
deployments. It offers an alternative method for deploying and managing
MicroCeph. In effect, the charm installs the ``microceph`` snap. As expected,
it provides MicroCeph management via standard Juju commands (e.g. ``juju
config`` and ``juju run``).

For more information, see the `microceph`_ entry on the Charmhub.

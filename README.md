# MicroCeph

MicroCeph is snap-deployed Ceph with built-in clustering.

MicroCeph handles scaling out the monitor cluster, as well as automating placement and management of the manager and metadata processes in a Ceph cluster when units are dynamically added via easy-to-use tooling. It also helps with adding disks (OSDs) to the Ceph cluster.
